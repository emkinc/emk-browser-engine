# V9.2.1

We're now in V9 of emk browser, We've added in loads of stuff!

Think of OpraGX but MUCH more light weight.. 

we've added in more performance frindly settings so that it can be so lightweight that it's using like NO ram at all or CPU at times 

it doesn't run in the background so that way when your gaming it's not boggling down your PC! 

It doesn't save info other then what you last did your search history and some other stuff so that way you can stay signed into your accounts instead of always having to resign in, But it doesnt save your name address any of that we don't allow you too.
